										Unlocking Insights from the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2019</a></h2>
										<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/so.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>Project Description:</p>
										<p>The Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey serves as a treasure trove of information for understanding the dynamics of the developer ecosystem worldwide. With this project, I embarked on a journey to extract meaningful insights from this extensive dataset. The project was structured around several key objectives:</p>
										<ol>
										<li> Data Cleaning: I started by meticulously cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency to prepare a robust foundation for analysis. </li>
										<li> Visualization: Utilizing Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created a series of visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns within the developer community. These visualizations ranged from simple bar charts to complex heatmaps, providing intuitive representations of the data. </li>
										<li> Analysis: With clean data and compelling visualizations in hand, I delved into the analysis phase, exploring various aspects such as average developer salaries per country, the prevalence of Python usage, preferred resources for problem-solving, and the correlation between developer salaries and age/gender. </li>
										<li> GitHub Repository: As a final step, I documented my code, findings, and visualizations in a GitHub repository, making it accessible to the wider community. Leveraging Git/GitHub commands, I ensured version control and collaborative development throughout the project lifecycle. </li>
										</ol>

									Visualizing Sales Trends: BigMart's 2011 Global Retail Analysis </a></h2>
									<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/sales.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Project Description:</p>
									<p>For the purposes of this exercise, I visualized the sales trends for BigMart, a fictional retail company, which is based in Europe and has operations across multiple countries around the globe. I worked with BigMart's Invoice-wise and Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU)-wise sales data for the year 2011. In this simulated scenario, I was a data analyst in BigMart's Information Technology (IT) team, and my goal was to prepare meaningful charts to showcase the various sales trends for 2011 to the company's top management. I displayed data for key issues pictorially to capture the top management's attention and bring these issues to their consideration. I accomplished this in several steps:</p>
									<ol>
										<li> Data Cleaning: I started by meticulously cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency to prepare a robust foundation for analysis. </li>
										<li> Visualization: Utilizing Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created a series of visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns within the sales data. These visualizations ranged from simple line graphs to complex bar charts and pie charts, providing intuitive representations of the data. </li>
										<li> Analysis: With clean data and compelling visualizations in hand, I delved into the analysis phase, exploring various aspects such as the top ten items sold in particular countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the highest- and lowest-performing months in terms of sales, and which countries contributed the most to BigMart's sales. </li>
										<li> GitHub Repository: As a final step, I documented my code, findings, and visualizations in a GitHub repository, making it accessible to the wider community. Leveraging Git/GitHub commands, I ensured version control and collaborative development throughout the project lifecycle. </li>
